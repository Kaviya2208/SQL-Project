# SQL-Project
The Hotel Management System using SQL only is a database project that manages hotel data like room bookings, customer records, staff details, and billing using SQL queries, tables, and relationships. The project simulates hotel operations through structured database design and SQL commands (e.g., INSERT, SELECT, JOIN, UPDATE, DELETE).

Project Objective:
To create a robust and well-structured SQL database that can:

Store and manage hotel data efficiently

Perform operations like booking rooms, checking availability, and calculating bills

Maintain data integrity using relationships and constraints

This SQL-only Hotel Management System demonstrates how structured data and well-written queries can replicate real-world hotel operations. Itâ€™s a strong foundational project that builds core skills in database design, normalization, and SQL query writing, which are essential for backend and data-related roles.
